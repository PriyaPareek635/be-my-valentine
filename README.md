# Project Overview: 

This is a lightweight, interactive landing page designed for Valentine's Day. It uses a mix of humor and charm to pop the big question: "Will you be my Valentine?"

## Key Features:

#### The Dodging "No" Button: 
A playful JavaScript feature where the "No" button moves randomly or shrinks as the user tries to click it.

#### Growing "Yes" Button: 
Alternatively, the "Yes" button grows larger with every "No" attempt, making the right choice inevitable!

#### Confetti & Animation: 
Trigger-based animations (like heart confetti or cute GIFs) that appear once the user accepts.

#### Responsive Design: 
Optimized for both mobile and desktop so it can be shared via a simple link.
